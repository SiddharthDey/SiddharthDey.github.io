My name is Siddharth Dey and I am currently a graduate student at University of Californa San Diego (UCSD) in the department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering with my major in Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Control. I am currently enrolled in CSE 291 "Deep Learning for 3D Data".

|     I completed my Bachelor of Technology (B.TEch) degree with honours in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Madras. I worked at Toyota Connected India (TCIN) as a Computer Vision Intern and at Fixnix, Chennai as a Data Analyst Intern. I researched under Prof. T. Asokan and Dr. Thiyagarajan on the modelling and optimization of an underwater glider. I also worked with Prof. Kameswararao Anupindi on feature extraction of Jet Flow dataset using Unsupervised Learning models. I was also part of Team Avishkar Hyperloop where I was responsible for the design and control of Active Leviation mechanism and Semi-Active Suspension.

Besides academics, I enjoy playing outdoor sports including Lawn Tennis and Soccer. I also love watching anime. Reach out to me if you are also waiting for the final chapter of Attack on Titan :)
