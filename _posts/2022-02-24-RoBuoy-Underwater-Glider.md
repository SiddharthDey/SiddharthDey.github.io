title: RoBuoy Underwater Glider
---

Worked with Prof. T. Ashokan and Prof. T. Ranganathan at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) on the design and development of an underwater glider for long-range oceanic exploration.

- Designed an underwater glider with a diving depth of up to 50 meters using metallic bellow and linear actuators

- Optimized the wing design parameters using Muli-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to maximize the glider's range and depth

- Simulated the glider's trajectory by modeling its dynamics in Simulink
