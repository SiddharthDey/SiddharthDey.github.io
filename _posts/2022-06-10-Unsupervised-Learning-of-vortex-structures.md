title: Unsupervised Learning of vortex structures
---

Worked with Prof. K. Anupindi on the application of unsupervised learning techniques to extract coherent structures from turbulent flows

- Simulated the turbulent characteristics of a ventilated jet flow for varying inlet velocity ratios in OpenFoam

- Employed Reduced-Order Models including Proper Orthogonal and Dynamic Mode Decomposition on the velocity data points to examine the flowâ€™s coherent structures and extract spatiotemporal information
