<!-- ![stairs_photo](/assets/stairs_1.jpg) <br /> <br /> -->
Won the "Most Innovative Approach" award at the Flipkart Grid 2.0 hackathon in the national final out of 6000+ participants

- Designed a bot based on a lead-screw mechanism to robustly carry a payload of 3-5kgs

- Trained YoloV5 to generate 2D bounding boxes for staircase detection

- Demonstrated a PID-based speed controller simulation using ROS with camera and ultrasonic sensors plugin for navigation and obstacle avoidance
